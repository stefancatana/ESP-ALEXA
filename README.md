In ESPALEXA.ino replace WIFI_SSID and WIFI_PASS with your own.
LAMP_1 and LAMP_2 can also be renamed in order to be shown on alexa app as you like.
RELAY_PIN_1 and RELAY_PIN_2 may also be changed as you wish.

Connect the ESP to the PC and upload the code.   

Next open the alexa app, tap devices and then the plus button from top right corner then add device and choose other from the list.
Or you can simply ask alexa to discover devices if yoy have an amazon echo speaker.
